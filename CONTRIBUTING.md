# Preamble

There are certain contribution guidelines established for adding new assets or modifying existing ones.

When contributing a new asset to Pandora, the contributors are required to fill in the following details:
 - Who is the contributor responsible for this asset, meaning who is to be contacted with questions or comments.
 - Their preferred policy on which changes they allow to their asset and which not.
 - Their preferred policy on how they allow their asset to be reused and how not.
 - The legal licensing for the images the asset uses.

For details about licensing, please check `ASSET_LICENSING.md` and `LICENSE`.

# Modification policy

Authors can choose from multiple policies on how they prefer their assets to be changed by others.

- `Free to change`
  - The author allows for any and all changes to their asset without further consent needed from them.
- `Fixes and New uses, otherwise ask`
  - The author allows anyone to make fixes to the current behaviour of the asset.
  - The author allows anyone to make this asset compatible with new features by modifying it or creating new variants.
  - The author requests to be asked before any changes not stated above are made to this asset.

# Reuse policy

Authors can choose from multiple policies on how they prefer their assets to be reusable by other asset creators for their assets. Note that if the author allows their asset to be reused, the reused parts are considered part of the new asset and are under the discretion of its author.

Authors can choose from the following policies for their assets:
- `Free to use`
  - The author allows anyone to reuse any part of this asset without further consent needed from them.
  - Note that licensing restrictions (for example, the requirement not to modify the images themselves) may still restrict usage.
