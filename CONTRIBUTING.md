# Preamble

There are certain contribution guidelines established for adding new assets or modifying existing ones.

When contributing a new asset to Pandora, the contributors are required to fill in the following details:
 - Who is the contributor responsible for this asset, meaning who is to be contacted with questions or comments.
 - Their preferred policy on which changes they allow to their asset and which not.
 - Their preferred policy on how they allow their asset to be reused and how not.
 - The legal licensing for the images the asset uses.

For details about licensing, please check `ASSET_LICENSING.md` and `LICENSE`.

Be aware that each asset contribution will be reviewed by the Pandora team. We may request changes if we consider any aspects, especially the consistency of asset properties among related assets in Pandora, to not fit to the vision of how we want Pandora to work. Please consider getting in contact with us using Discord, if you have any questions or doubts about your asset idea. We will try to work together with you to get your contribution into Pandora.

# Acceptable assets

Not all assets are equal, and some could be controversial or even harmful to Pandora, to its community, or to any individual visiting it. Before making an asset, please review the below list of things we consider problematic.

## Things we are opposed to

- Items, of which possession in private is illegal in the EU
- Assets which depict acts that are illegal in the EU
- Weapons
  - ✅ Example(s) OK: scissors, small hammer, foam sword, recognizable water gun
  - ❔ Example(s) needing a discussion: kitchen knife, toy gun, sword prop
  - ❌ Example(s) not OK: assets recognizable as an item that is primarily used as a weapon, e.g. a firearm
- Any real legal or illegal drugs
  - ✅ Example(s) OK: unspecified pills, unspecified powder, unspecified liquids
  - ❌ Example(s) not OK: assets called "drug" or referencing real illegal substances by name, assets that describe an effect of problematic substances
- Cigarettes, including electric ones
- Assets containing symbols protected by international treaties, such as the red cross
- Anything mentioning any real-world brand, trademark or a real person; unless you own the brand or are the person in question and provide proof of that
- Assets which promote a political or religious agenda
  - ✅ Example(s) OK: religious clothes like a nun's habit
  - ❌ Example(s) not OK: symbols, flags, slogans
- Assets that wouldn't be morally acceptable for the developer team (i.e. we reserve the right to change our minds)
  - ❔ Example(s): If you wonder whether your new asset might not be morally acceptable for us, please approach us before you start the work!

## Assets where you should tread very carefully and discuss your approach with us

- Assets that are related to or with visual/graphical depictions of blood, gore, or bodily harm
  - ✅ Example(s) OK: syringe, bandage without blood, band aids
  - ❔ Example(s) needing a discussion: medical knife, needles, stitches, any kind of "bruising", assets that can be used to depict loss of life
- Assets with explicit visual/graphical depictions of scat or watersports
  - ✅ Example(s) OK: diapers without stains, toilet room device, enema equipment
  - ❔ Example(s) needing a discussion: feces, urine
- Assets that are closely related to being underage
  - ✅ Example(s) OK: onesie, pacifier, diapers, crib, rattle
  - ❔ Example(s) needing a discussion: anything visually/graphically depicting a character as underage while making it hard to recognize they are an adult
- Assets that can trigger common phobias in users when they suddenly see them:
  - ✅ Example(s) OK: dog pet play assets, syringe
  - ❔ Example(s) needing a discussion: assets showing or depicting snakes, spiders, or similar looking insects

**Note**: We may loosen the requirements on some of those categories in the future when we have the ability to set item limits on individual modules of an asset and/or have the ability to not render (parts of) controversial assets visually for new accounts by default, so users have to specifically opt-in to see them in their potentially controversial form.

# Modification policy

Authors can choose from multiple policies on how they prefer their assets to be changed by others. Note that an asset can always be entirely removed from the game if the Pandora team decides, for any reason, including but not limited to it being broken and the author preferring it not to be modified.

Authors can choose from the following policies for their assets:
- `Free to change`
  - The author allows for any and all changes to their asset without further consent needed from them.
- `Fixes and New uses, otherwise ask`
  - The author allows anyone to make fixes to the current behaviour of the asset.
  - The author allows anyone to make this asset compatible with new features by modifying it or creating new variants.
  - The author requests to be asked before any changes not stated above are made to this asset.
- `Fixes and New uses`
  - The author allows anyone to make fixes to the current behaviour of the asset.
  - The author allows anyone to make this asset compatible with new features by modifying it or creating new variants.
  - The author requests that no other changes are made to this asset by others.
- `Fixes only, otherwise ask`
  - The author allows anyone to make fixes to the current behaviour of the asset.
  - The author requests to be asked before any changes not stated above are made to this asset.
- `Fixes only`
  - The author allows anyone to make fixes to the current behaviour of the asset.
  - The author requests that no other changes are made to this asset by others.
- `Ask first`
  - The author requests to be asked before any changes are made to this asset.
- `No Changes`
  - The author requests that no changes are made to this asset at all.

# Reuse policy

Authors can choose from multiple policies on how they prefer their assets to be reusable by other asset creators for their assets. Note that if the author allows their asset to be reused, the reused parts are considered part of the new asset and are under the discretion of its author.

Authors can choose from the following policies for their assets:
- `Free to use`
  - The author allows anyone to reuse any part of this asset without further consent needed from them.
  - Note that licensing restrictions (for example, the requirement not to modify the images themselves) may still restrict usage.
- `Ask first`
  - The author requests to be asked before any part of this asset is reused for other assets.
  - Note that licensing restrictions (for example, the requirement not to modify the images themselves) may still restrict usage.
- `No reuse`
  - The author requests that no part of this asset is reused in any way for other assets.
