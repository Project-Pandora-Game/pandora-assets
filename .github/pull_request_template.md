Thank you for your pull request!

These comments will guide you through creating a pull request and filling in all that is required. You don't need to remove the comments when you are done.
You can view CONTRIBUTING.md for a detailed description of the pull request process.

Title for the pull request should be in the following form: [TYPE] Short name that is understandable by itself
TYPE should be one of the following: FEATURE, ADD, CHANGE, REMOVE, FIX, REFACTOR, DEV, CHORE
The rest of the title should describe what the PR changes mainly, doesn't need to describe the details of the change (someone looking at the list of PRs should be able to tell which asset it touches, not necessarily how).
Use past tense.

fixes #42

## About The Pull Request

<!--
Describe *what* you are trying to do.
This sets expectation for the reviewer, making it easier to get into reviewing it.
e.g. Added a new hair asset.

[optional]
If there is something complex, then try to explain why and how is was accomplished and why was this particualar approach chosen.
This is, however, much less important than the "what" part.

## Changelog

<!--
Write a changelog following the examples below.
The changelog should be aimed at players - it shouldn't contain technical details and it should be concise.
Use past tense. For more complex changes you can write several points or include links to where interested people can find more details.
Leave the changelog wrapped in a codeblock and leave the "Assets" leading text.

If the PR doesn't change anything users or asset developers can notice, it is fine to remove this section altogether.
